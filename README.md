### Instructions

	1. To get a copy of the repo, clone it using the command below:

		```
		git clone https://github.com/JerelynCo/SLTranslator.git
		```

	2. Work on your own branch

		* To get the branches from remote:

			```
			git branch -a
			git checkout -b branchname origin/[branchname] //creates a branch, pulls the commits from remote branch, and checkouts/uses it
			```

		* Branching:
			1. **master**: Updated only if significant changes/milestones are done.
			2. **[user]**: Namely Je and Rocell. Work on your respective branch. Add more if you wish to by appending "-description". Ex. Je-dev

		* When changes are made, make sure to commit with detailed message and push it to your own branch.

			```
			git status //checks the status of your local repository
			git add [files that were changed] //adds the files to the bank of files to be committed
			git commit -am "message" //commits the changes. Make sure the message is **detailed**
			git push origin:[branchname]
			```
